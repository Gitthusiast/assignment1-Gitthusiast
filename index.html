      <p>This web page is a humbly devoted to the most interesting guy I've ever known, my grandpa Naum Dorfman.</p>
      <p>Naum was born in 1940 to a jewish family a year before 2nd ww has stuck russia. One year old whose father had been drafted 
        into the army, had to escape approaching nazi forces. Naum's mother Faina Dorfman took four children including my one year
        old grandpa and evacuated to northen russia. During war his father served in the protecting forces near Leningrad, 
        a famous historical blockade called "The Siege of Leningrad" for which he recieved an order of the red star for bravery.
        At the end of the war by some mircle my grandpa, his mother and two sisters who survived the war reunited with their
        father and relocated back to the city were my grandfather Naum was born - Polotsk. 
      </p>
      <p>His military service my grandpa undertook in a northen russian iceland called "Novaya Zemlya". Novaya Zemlya was the site
        of one of the two major nuclear test sites managed by the USSR, used for air drops and underground testing of the largest
        of Soviet nuclear bombs. Some stories from his serviece my grandpa keeps to himself up to this day, but he told me that 
        he used to encounter white polar bears on a daily basis, and that the soldiers treated them like cats, even let them get close.
      </p>
      <p>In 1964 my grandpa married my beautiful grandma who he loved deeply, but bacause his parents didn't accept her he had to
        relocate from his birth town and move to a place where he could find a job - a village near the city Krasnoyarsk, Siberia.
        There, under extreme coldness (I assume) my father has been born, In the middle of a forest!
      </p>
      <p>
        My father and his little sister grew up in that same city their ancestors lived generations in - Polotsk, where their mad parents
        later returned. In 1991 my father moved to Israel, and in 1993 his parents and younger sister followed him. This day my
        cool grandpa is a cute old man who you'd never assume has such an interesting past. From a kid who survived the war and the
        following hungry years in russia, brave soldier who helped scientists research radioactive lands to a kind and carrying family man.
        I love my grandpa and I think he cooks the best cabbage soup in the world(russian soup called Shchi).

      <h1>Web1, Web2 and Web3</h1>
      <p>Web1 was the very beginning of the world wide web, it's main purpose was to present data.
          Whereas web2 braught us the integration, the ability to share information and learn from our peers.
          Web3 made things a bit smarter, turning the web to semantic web allowing information to link to each other
          tagging information automaticaly.</p>
